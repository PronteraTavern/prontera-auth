# Prontera Auth ðŸ”’
This project is meant to explore User Management domain concepts such as Authentication and Authorization protocols, soft delete, MFA, SSO, Token Refreshing, Audit Logs, and possibly RBAC. The idea is that in the future we can use this project as a library or micro-service for authenticating users of a real project.

We want to start simple and incrementally explore the topics listed above as the project advances.


## First Version (WIP)
This project will be a simple REST API with the capabilities to create, authenticate, and authorize users through [JWT](https://jwt.io/). It will use a Database (TBD) to store user's account information.
